Based solver for different generations of the Patience game (smth like Solitaire in English - speaking countries)

The main idea:
  - create a field with entered parametres
  - use deapth - first - search to write logic for the program


Coming soon:
  - Optimize brootforce, which is O(n^2) to O(n) using algorithm A* (A star)

Algorithm A*:
  - search algorithm that finds the least cost route in a weighted graph from a starting vertex to a chosen ending vertex.
